I am an entrepreneur and full-stack software engineer using biologically-inspired computational and mathematical modeling techniques to architect adaptive software, data visualizations, and decentralized technology solutions. I’m Co-founder of [Wade & Wendy](http://wadeandwendy.ai/), where we are building artificial personalities to make hiring more human.

I previously advised on strategy and technology at [Harmony Institute](http://harmony-institute.org/), an interdisciplinary research center that explores media impact. I also formerly led development of HI’s [StoryPilot](https://storypilot.org/) media impact and exploration platform, and was a Core Developer and protocol architect for the Bitcoin-based [Storj](http://storj.io/) project.

I directed and developed technology infrastructure and interactive applications at the [National Museum of Mathematics](http://momath.org/) in NYC through its grand opening.

For a while, I also imported, distributed and promoted a rose-based candy in all 50 U.S. states.

I’m intrigued by complex systems, emergent behavior, swarm intelligence and decentralization. I’ve developed novel [swarming algorithms](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20760-0_4) for robots and studied permaculture design.
