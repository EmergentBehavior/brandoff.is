I'm the Co-founder and Lead Engineer at [Wade & Wendy](http://wadeandwendy.ai), a venture-backed startup in NYC building artificially intelligent personalities that grow real relationships through chat. Previously, I was a Core Developer at [Storj](http://storj.io/), a Bitcoin-based decentralized storage platform, and the Lead Developer at [Harmony Institute](http://harmony-institute.org), an interdisciplinary research center exploring the science of narrative media. Before that, I was the founding technologist at the National Museum of Mathematics. For several years, I also imported, promoted and distributed a rose-based sweet to every state in the U.S.

I'm deeply interested in complex systems, emergent behavior and distributed or decentralized systems and have [published work](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-20760-0_4) on genetic stigmergy, a biologically-inspired algorithm that supports self-organization of robotic swarms. I've also studied permaculture design with [Andrew Faust](http://www.permaculturenewyork.com/).

My current languages of choice include Go, Python, Clojure and ES6/ES7-style JavaScript. Always be testin'.
